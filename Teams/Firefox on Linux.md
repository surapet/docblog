In order for Teams to work somewhat properly on Firefox under Linux, you need to enable the Cisco OpenH264 plugin.
The plugin automtically downloads when you first go to Teams, but it gets installed in a disabled state.  To
Activate the plugin, go to about:addons then click on Plugins.  The Cisco OpenH264 plugin should be listed but set to disabled.
Click the ellipse in the upper righthand corner of the box and then select "Alway Activate".  This should activate the plugin
but some articles state that Firefox may need to be restarted to get the full effect.
